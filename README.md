# 6.TicTacToe_GUI
This is a TicTacToe game which has a Graphical Interface. 

I started this project to learn more about application creations. I searched around and found that Tkinter is a library which helps with the creation of graphical interface. I made a tictactoe GUI because I already had expierence with creating tictactoe plus I thought it would be easier. Although, the easier part went backwards. Learning tkinter helped me not only look more into the software development side but also see how things are structured. Additionally, when creating this I utilized OOP because I knew structuring this would make it neater, but also more helpful. It was helpful when I ran into problems with variables turns out it matters where you place functions. 

This was a tough project not only because learning tkinter, and figuring out how to code a GUI, but because I had other errands. I am also travelling to Canada for a while so I might not be able to create more projects. However, I will try.
